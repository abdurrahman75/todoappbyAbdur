Objective 1:

-> Run node tc.js  and go to localhost:8080/. You will see a input form to enter first and 
last name. When you submit, you will be directed to localhost:8080/form-submission page
where you can see what you type.

Objective 2:
For this part, go to localhost:8080/file-upload-page and there you'll see an input to 
upload a file. You can submit a image file and it will redirect to localhost:8080/image-
submission. You can't see anything, as I couldn't read the image file. But, I created a 
writeable stream which was supposed to read data from image. But it failed to read image 
data. You can see in console log the data received. 

Objective 3:
As I couldn't read data from images in objective 2, I tried to use an existing image in my
directory. For this one, I tried to create a path at localhost:8080/images/image-1 which 
is supposed to retrieve image-1.png from my directory.

Objective 4: For this one, I created a html-template file which you can access at 
localhost:8080/html-template which doesn't portray images as no images are saved in my 
directory as it should be according to objective 2.
