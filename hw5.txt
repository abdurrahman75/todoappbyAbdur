Running Instruction:
Type node hw5.js

Objective 1:
-> Go to localhost:8080/ and click make an ajax request. You'll see that an ajax
request has been placed without refreshing the site.

Objective 2:

-> Go to localhost:8080/ and click on submit button AJAX post section. You will be
confirmed that your input is saved in the server called message.txt. You can enter multiple
inputs with different values.

Objective 3:
-> Go to localhost:8080/ and click get all the contents you submitted, you'll get 
all the contents that you submitted previously.

Objective 4

->  Go to localhost:8080/ and click the button under Objective 4 button. It's retrieving 
data from message.txt, although for some reason it takes time. I set the interval to 10000
in the html file. I tried to minimize the interval time, still it takes a lot of time, may
be my server can't handle a lot of request. But, you can see in the browser console, A 
request has been made and it should retrieve the first line from message.txt. After every
request, I delete the first line and the second line becomes first line for the next request. 
For the html injection, I prevent input and url with '<' and '>' to be enter my server code.
